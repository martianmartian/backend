        <i>Hey Guys,</i>

        <p>Thank you for being patient with me... <br><br>

        So finally we are entering the advertising and marketing phase of the company; I know it's been a long wait, and probably there will be longer time when we don't have much business; but please bear with us. We are doing all we can to get our words out there.<br><br>

        There are two parts of our marketing campaign, one is online, one is from Purdue University campus.<br><br>
        This coming monday is the first day of second summer semester; we are anticipating a lot more visitors to our site since we have a small group of people going to be advertising to International students on campus.<br><br>
        I'm hoping some of you can start to stay online whenever possible starting on Sunday evening.<br><br>
        Since our system isn't completed yet, we need you to keep a record of who you have talked to; and how long it lasted.<br><br>
        Also, more training will be underway, so don't worry if not knowing what to do at the moment...<br><br>
        Important Note:<br><br>
        please logout or close the tab before you close your computer; the system needs to know somehow that you are offline..<br><br>please refresh the tutor page whenever you have finished a session with a student to inform system that you are still online.<br><br>Feel free to let me know whenever you have question!</p>

        <p>Best,<br><br>Xiao</p>

        I'm looking for English tutors who're willing to work before end of this semester and during summer. 

        Tutoring process is mostly through internet, so if you are not going to be on campus during the summer, it would still work out. Or meetup is acceptable if you prefer. 
         
        I'm looking for people who're: 
        Fluent in English; 
        Have past experience (at least have taught someone once or twice in the past) 
        Any computer skills will be greatly valued, but without them is fine. 
         
        Payment can be negotiated, or you can volunteer if you enjoy helping out :-) 
        I'm considering somewhere between $8-$12 per working hour;  
        But if you are really good at it, I will consider raising fairly. 
         
        How to get in touch:
